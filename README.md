FEA Optimization of an PM Electric Machine
==================
This files are to try an 3D FEA optimization algorithm for a hybrid PM machine. 
The machine uses two different magnets(NdFeB-Samarium Cobalt) with different properties and cost. 
Optimization algorithm tries to minimize the overall cost.
The FEA model can be modified to optimize other magnetostatic problems.

Following tools are used:
* FEA: Opera - Vector fields
* R: for data process
* Rgenoud: R package for genetic optimization

This is not a full project, but a test for FEA optimizations.
Please contact me if you have any questions.
